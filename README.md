# Would You Rather app


This project creates a simple Would You Rather game, which is a game where you pick one of two options; the game asks you, 'Which one would you rather pick?'

In this app, users are able to answer questions, post new questions,  see how other people have voted, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The app's UI is governed by React and its State is managed by Redux.
